# Project handover for Daphnet extraction (2025-08-18 19:14Z)

_**User**_

Please familiarise yourself with this project

Handover Summary – “Daphnet Extraction” Progress
================================================
Current project state
Core extractor: scaffold-source-texts/scaffold/extract.py
Async, rate-limited, checkpoints, graceful SIGINT, DEBUG flag -v.
Logic: scans Presocratics DK chapters, tries .rdf, falls back to .plain.html / .html.
Letter-suffix probing added; stop condition: after first hit, 5 straight 404/500s.
Progress log every 10 attempts.
Config: scaffold-source-texts/scaffold/config.yaml (all tunables).
Unified loader: config_loader.py (for all scripts).
Catalogue-first utilities:
scan_presocratic_books.py NEW
▸ Reads data/presocratic_hyperlinks.csv (book-transcription URLs).
▸ Crawls each once, extracts every fragment link (siglum + id).
▸ Writes data/daphnet/presocratics_catalogue.json with reference, id, html_url, plain_url, rdf_url.
Hyperlink CSVs available for other collections:
data/socratics_hyperlinks.csv
data/laertius_hyperlinks.csv
data/sextus_hyperlink.csv
What’s working
Running python scaffold-source-texts/scaffold/extract.py --test -v now logs each URL with status and gathers real fragments (DK 22 shown).
Five-miss rule keeps iteration fast.
Checkpoints appear under data/daphnet/checkpoints/.
Book-page crawler finishes quickly and produces a definitive fragment list without server errors.
Next recommended tasks
A. Integrate catalogue into extractor
If presocratics_catalogue.json exists, load it and iterate rows instead of brute-force loops.
Record id in Record dataclass.
B. Create similar scanners for Socratics / Laertius / Sextus using their _hyperlinks.csv files (logic identical; only collection name and URL path differ).
C. Swap extractor to handle all catalogue files with a --from-catalogue flag (or auto-detect).
D. Once catalogue path is solid, lower base_delay (currently 2 s) to ≈0.5 s – server will get only a fraction of original hits.
E. Extend coverage report to count against catalogue length.
F. Documentation: update README to reflect catalogue-driven flow (Phase 0 scanner, Phase 1 extractor).
How to run current pieces
v
Key files / directories
scaffold-source-texts/scaffold/ – all scripts
scaffold-source-texts/data/*.csv – pre-scraped hyperlink indexes
data/daphnet/ – outputs:
presocratics_catalogue.json (new)
daphnet_corpus.json, daphnet_texts.txt, coverage.json
checkpoints/ (JSON snapshots)
Pending improvements (easy)
Add SIGINT checkpointing to scan_presocratic_books.py.
Deduplicate HTTP headers code (helper function).
Add retries to book-page fetch (currently 1 attempt).
Optionally store raw book pages for offline parsing cache.
With this handover, a new developer can:
Crawl any collection rapidly via the hyperlink CSV approach.
Integrate catalogue consumption into the extractor.
Proceed to bulk extraction with minimal server load and high reliability.
Feel free to share this block in another window – it captures the complete technical context and next steps.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring file summaries**

I’m thinking about how to create a summary that aligns with our understanding. I might need to read some key code files first to get familiar. I don’t think I'll need any tool calls just yet, aside from maybe reviewing the structure of the code. The approach encourages reading multiple files at once for better comprehension. I’ll start with config.yaml, extract.py, and scan_presocratic_books.py to gather insights quickly.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Creating a to-do list**

I’m thinking about summarizing the tasks we've identified, and I want to create a clear to-do list. This list will include tasks A-F, and I need to follow the guidelines to ensure there are at least two items marked correctly, like the first one being “in progress.” 

Here are my tasks:

1. Familiarize myself with the project (in progress)
2. Integrate catalogue loading into the extractor (pending)
3. Add catalogue scanners (pending)
4. Implement flag detection in the extractor (pending)
5. Lower base delay after integration (pending)
6. Extend coverage report (pending)
7. Update README for catalogue flow (pending)
8. Add checkpointing to scanners (pending)
9. Deduplicate HTTP header code (pending)
**Updating the to-do list**

I’ve got a couple more tasks to add to my to-do list. I’ll mark the first task as “in progress” to follow the guidelines. 

Here’s what I have now:

1. Familiarize myself with the project (in progress)
2. Integrate catalogue loading into the extractor (pending)
3. Add catalogue scanners (pending)
4. Implement flag detection in the extractor (pending)

Here’s a concise overview of what I’ve learned about the “Daphnet Extraction” project and its current status:

Key components already in place
• `scaffold-source-texts/scaffold/extract.py` – asynchronous extractor with:
  – Presocratics brute-force probe (smart five-miss stop rule, letter-suffix probing).  
  – Robust rate limit / back-off, retries, graceful SIGINT checkpoints.  
  – RDF + HTML/“plain” handling, Greek-text validation, coverage reporting.  

• `scaffold-source-texts/scaffold/scan_presocratic_books.py` – catalogue builder that:
  – Reads pre-scraped `presocratic_hyperlinks.csv`.  
  – Crawls each book page once, extracts fragment links (siglum + id).  
  – Writes `data/daphnet/presocratics_catalogue.json` for extractor consumption.  

• Central configuration in `scaffold-source-texts/scaffold/config.yaml`; shared loader `config_loader.py`.

Outputs go to `data/daphnet/`: corpus JSON, plain-text dump, coverage report, checkpoints.

Recommended next steps (from handover)
A Integrate catalogue usage into extractor (consume `*_catalogue.json` rows instead of brute force).  
B Add identical scanners for Socratics, Laertius, Sextus (already-available hyperlink CSVs).  
C Add `--from-catalogue` flag or auto-detect catalogue presence.  
D After catalogue path is stable, lower `base_delay` to ≈ 0.5 s.  
E Extend coverage report to compare against catalogue length.  
F Update documentation (README) to describe the catalogue-driven workflow.

Easy enhancements
• SIGINT checkpointing for catalogue scanners.  
• Deduplicate header construction; add retry logic for book-page fetch; optional local cache.

My task list
I have created a detailed todo list tracking these items and marked “Familiarise with project” as in progress. Next I’ll:

1. Design the extractor-catalogue integration (task_integrate_catalogue).  
2. Prototype catalogue processing inside `extract.py`, preserving current CLI behaviour.  
3. Parallelise similar scanners for the other collections.

Let me know if you’d like me to prioritise a specific task or have any questions about the planned work.

_**User**_

Please create a to-do list and carry on

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating the to-do list**

The user wants me to make an updated to-do list and continue with tasks. Since we've created one before, I need to mark "familiarization" as completed and set "integrate catalogue" as in progress. I should also break down the tasks into subtasks for better organization. I have to ensure that the new structure meets the requirements, so I'll merge the existing tasks while adding the new statuses, ultimately preparing a more useful to-do list.
**Updating tasks and subtasks**

I'm planning to mark the "integrate catalogue" task as in progress while keeping the others pending. I’m thinking it would be helpful to create new subtasks under "integrate catalogue," like loading the catalogue, adding CLI flags, iterating records, and including record IDs. This would provide better clarity and structure. Next, I’ll proceed to update the to-do list with these changes, ensuring the user has a detailed overview of the ongoing tasks.</details></think>

## Todo List

- [x] Familiarise with project structure, extraction flow, and codebase
- [-] Integrate catalogue consumption into extractor when presocratics_catalogue.json exists
- [ ] Implement scanners for Socratics, Laertius, and Sextus collections using their hyperlink CSVs
- [ ] Add --from-catalogue flag or auto-detection in extractor to switch between catalogue and brute-force

- [ ] Add retry logic to book-page fetch in scanners
- [ ] Optionally cache raw book pages locally for offline parsing

---

A multi-step task list is now in place and I’ve marked “integrate catalogue into extractor” as in-progress. 

Next action: start modifying `scaffold-source-texts/scaffold/extract.py` so that, when a catalogue file exists, the extractor iterates those rows instead of brute-force loops. I’ll handle this now and update the todo list as progress is made.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning Catalogue Integration**

The user wants to continue, and I’ve got a task list to integrate the catalogue into the extractor. My focus is on modifying extract.py to detect the catalogue file and streamline the code. I'll plan for a method called load_catalogue() to read the JSON and return a list. Additionally, I’ll create a new scan_presocratics_catalogue() to iterate properly. I also need to incorporate a CLI flag for this with appropriate checks and ensure to format the code correctly with docstrings and type annotations.
**Implementing Incremental Changes**

I’m considering the complexities of this task, but I can implement small, incremental modifications. First, I’ll add necessary imports, including the Path type. Then, I need to set up a `--from-catalogue` flag in the argument parser. In the `run()` method, I’ll check if the flag is set or if the configuration detects a catalogue file, leading to the new method `scan_presocratics_catalogue()`, which will loop through JSON rows. I'll focus on implementing this efficiently, ensuring to track progress as I go.
**Defining the Catalogue Scanning Method**

I’m detailing the new method `scan_presocratics_catalogue()`, which will log the scanning process and check for the existence of the catalogue file. If found, it will read the data and process each row, determining the appropriate URL to extract records. I’ll also need to track progress and add checkpointing. Next, I’ll implement code edits to update `parse_args` for a new argument and modify the `run` method to include conditional logic for the catalogue scanning. Finally, I'll prepare to make these edits efficiently.</details></think>

Catalogue support has been added:

• New CLI flag `--from-catalogue`.
• Automatic fallback to the catalogue (`data/daphnet/presocratics_catalogue.json`) if it exists.
• New asynchronous method `scan_presocratics_catalogue` loops through catalogue rows, chooses RDF vs. plain HTML, logs progress, and checkpoints as before.

No linting issues were introduced and the todo “Integrate catalogue into extractor” is now completed.

Next in priority is creating scanners for Socratics, Laertius, and Sextus to generate their own catalogues. Let me know if you’d like me to proceed with that or tackle another item first.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Proceeding with scanner implementation**

The user has confirmed to proceed, suggesting I should create scanners for Socratics, Laertius, and Sextus as outlined in the to-do list. 

My tasks include implementing scanner scripts similar to the existing one for Presocratics using their respective hyperlink CSV files. I’ll need to read the CSVs to understand their structure and decide whether to create separate scripts or a unified one with parameters for each collection. I'll aim for clarity and efficiency in this process.
**Exploring CSV structure**

I’m considering creating a single script that uses command line arguments to specify different collections. However, I can also make separate files if that proves easier. 

To kick things off, I’ll examine the CSV for Socratics to understand its structure better. I’ll read the file to see the first few lines, which should help me gather insights from the sample CSVs. This way, I can proceed with a more informed implementation strategy.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Refactoring CSV scripts**

I need to ensure all the CSVs have the same header, which invites the idea of creating a generic scanner script that takes parameters like CSV path, output catalog filename, and a collection type (like presocratics or socratics). For speed, I could just copy the existing presocratic script and modify it. However, refactoring the code in scan_presocratic_books.py into a more generic function might be the best approach long-term. For now, I'll focus on implementing scan_other_books.py with its collection argument and CSV file path. Let's check config_loader.py for the base path functions.</details></think>

- [x] Integrate catalogue consumption into extractor when presocratics_catalogue.json exists
- [x] Implement scanners for Socratics, Laertius, and Sextus collections using their hyperlink CSVs

- [ ] Add retry logic to book-page fetch in scanners
- [ ] Optionally cache raw book pages locally for offline parsing

---

Created a single generic scanner script `scan_catalogue.py` that now supports:

• `presocratics`, `socratics`, `laertius`, and `sextus` collections  
• Reads the appropriate `*_hyperlinks.csv` file  
• Crawls each book-transcription page, extracts fragment links, builds rows containing `html_url`, `plain_url`, and `rdf_url`  
• Writes the catalogue JSON to `data/daphnet/<collection>_catalogue.json`

Example usage:
```
python scaffold-source-texts/scaffold/scan_catalogue.py --collection socratics
```

No lint errors. The todo “scanners for other collections” is now completed.

Next logical step would be to improve the CLI experience—marking “flag --from-catalogue / auto-detect” as in-progress—or work on coverage comparison. Let me know which task you’d like to prioritise.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing task updates**

I've got a list of tasks to work through: I need to reduce delay, extend coverage, update the README, implement checkpointing, deduplicate headers, retry fetching a book, and cache pages. The user wants me to go through these systematically, so I'll start by marking the task_flag_catalogue as completed.  

Next, I think extending coverage is crucial. I'll update the generate_coverage_report to count expected records for each collection by reading the catalogue JSON if it exists. It’s essential to gather those counts for accurate results!
**Updating coverage metrics**

I need to provide metrics like 'expected_records' and 'coverage_ratio', and maybe add some new config for that. I can compute expected catalogs for each attempted collection by creating length dictionaries and reading the catalogue file path for each collection. 

I'll implement a helper method called get_catalogue_length to facilitate this and then generate a coverage report accordingly. I must ensure the code follows strict guidelines, patch the extractor file, and update the todo list. I’ll set 'task_extend_coverage' as in progress and make sure to read lints after the changes. Let's get started on this patch!</details></think>

Coverage reporting is now richer: each attempted collection shows expected fragments (from its `_catalogue.json`), extracted count, and ratio. No lint issues.

Remaining top-priority tasks:
• Finalise `task_flag_catalogue` (extend auto-detection to all collections).  
• Lower `base_delay` in the YAML when catalogue path is fully adopted.  
• Documentation update (README).  
• Small robustness items: SIGINT for scanners, header deduplication, retry logic, optional caching.

Let me know which one you’d like tackled next or if we should continue sequentially down the list.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning extractor tasks**

The user wants me to carry on with our to-do list. The next task is to implement the `--from-catalogue` flag for the extractor, which we've already added for presocratics, along with auto-detection. However, this functionality isn't yet available for other collections since we don't have scanning functions for them. Currently, the extractor can only scan for presocratics. I need to consider how to incorporate the auto-detection and ensure the extractor chooses the catalogue for all collections.
**Implementing catalogue scanning**

I’m considering how to support catalogue scanning for collections while bypassing brute force. I could introduce a new method, `scan_catalogue(collection)`, to handle the scanning of catalogue files for specific collections. The extractor currently lacks support for 'socratics', 'laertius', and 'sextus', so I need to create a generic scanning method to load records. 

The plan includes unifying the existing methods and ensuring seamless operation. I'll also log errors for collections without catalogue files, refine the `--from-catalogue` flag, and complete the relevant tasks in our to-do list. Let’s get modifying the extractor!
**Adjusting scan methods**

I recently added a function for scanning the presocratics catalogue, but I’m thinking it would be better to convert this to a more generic method called `scan_catalogue(collection: str)`. This way, I can streamline the code. To keep changes manageable, I’ll create this new method without making too many edits right away. 

I'll modify the run loop to utilize the new method for scanning presocratics, and later I can remove the old method or replace it with the new one. I just need to check the current code in extract.py to move forward!</details></think>

---

Auto-detection / `--from-catalogue` support is now universal:

• New `scan_catalogue(collection)` handles any catalogue JSON.  
• Old `scan_presocratics_catalogue` now delegates to this generic method.  
• `run()` checks for `--from-catalogue` flag or presence of `<collection>_catalogue.json`.  
  – If yes → catalogue path.  
  – Else → Presocratics brute-force or skip with a warning for other collections.

No lint issues introduced; todo “flag catalogue” is complete.

Open tasks in the queue:
1. Lower `base_delay` (after catalogue path proven stable).  
2. Update README with catalogue-driven workflow.  
3. Add SIGINT checkpointing to scanner script(s).  
4. Deduplicate HTTP header logic across modules.  
5. Retry logic + optional page caching for scanners.

Let me know if you want a specific one tackled first or prefer continuing down the list sequentially.

+ ### Catalogue-driven Workflow
+ 
+ 1. **Phase 0 – Build catalogues**
+    Run one of the scanners once per collection to create a definitive fragment list:
+    ```bash
+    # Presocratics
+    python scaffold/scan_catalogue.py --collection presocratics
+ 
+    # Socratics, Laertius, Sextus
+    python scaffold/scan_catalogue.py --collection socratics
+    python scaffold/scan_catalogue.py --collection laertius
+    python scaffold/scan_catalogue.py --collection sextus
+    ```
+    Each command writes a `<collection>_catalogue.json` file to `data/daphnet/`.
+ 
+ 2. **Phase 1 – Extract texts**
+    The extractor now auto-detects catalogue files (or use `--from-catalogue`) and iterates them instead of brute-force probing:
+    ```bash
+    # Fast extraction using catalogues (0.5 s delay by default)
+    python scaffold/extract.py --collections presocratics socratics laertius sextus --verbose
+    ```
+ 
+    If a catalogue is missing for a requested collection, the extractor will skip it unless a legacy brute-force scanner exists (currently only Presocratics).
+ 
+ 3. **Tuning**
+    Base request delay has been lowered to **0.5 s** in `config.yaml` because the catalogue approach drastically reduces server load.
+ 
  ### RDF Support
  The extractor can fetch RDF metadata alongside HTML content:

We’ve completed the next two items:

1. **Reduced request delay** – `config.yaml` now sets `base_delay: 0.5` s.  
2. **Updated README** – added a “Catalogue-driven Workflow” section describing Phase 0 scanners, Phase 1 extractor, and the new default delay.

Remaining tasks:

• task_sigint_scanner – add Ctrl-C checkpointing to the generic `scan_catalogue.py`.  
• task_dedup_headers – move common header dict into a helper.  
• task_retry_book_fetch – add retry loop to scanners.  
• task_cache_pages – optional HTML caching for offline parsing.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning task execution**

The user wants me to proceed with the remaining tasks, which include SIGINT checkpointing in the scanner, deduping headers, retrying book fetch, and caching pages. I’ll start by adding SIGINT handling in `scan_catalogue.py`. To do this, I'll track task progress and create a JSON file with partial results in case of an interrupt. For deduping headers, I'll craft a helper function, potentially in a new utility file. I’ll also look at implementing a retry loop for fetching HTML.
**Updating tasks**

It seems like defining constant HEADERS in `config_loader` could work, and I’ll update `scan_catalogue.py` to use that function, along with the extractor. However, I really want to focus on SIGINT handling and implementing retries first. 

I'll create a global variable for the state in `scan_catalogue.py`, and define a handle_interrupt function to save collected rows, print a message, and exit. I’ll also set up a signal handler and implement a retry mechanism for `fetch_html`. Once completing these, I can mark the SIGINT scanner and retry fetch tasks as done, while noting that deduping headers and caching pages are still pending.</details></think>

Scanner script now:

• Handles Ctrl-C gracefully – on interrupt it writes the catalogue gathered so far before exiting.  
• `fetch_html` includes a simple 3-attempt retry with exponential back-off for transient errors/timeouts.

Todo list update:
– task_sigint_scanner and task_retry_book_fetch are now completed.  
Pending tasks: header deduplication and (optional) page-caching.

Let me know if you’d like to implement shared header construction next or explore offline caching.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing HTTP headers**

The user mentioned "http headers", which suggests we need to work on a task centered around deduplicating HTTP headers. I’m thinking about creating a helper function for constructing headers that can be shared by both the extractor and the scanner. I plan to create a new file in the project for this function, implementing it similarly to the way headers are constructed in the existing setup. I’ll also ensure we follow formatting guidelines properly while doing this.
**Updating HTTP header functions**

I’m planning to update the `extract.py` setup function to utilize a new helper function for building default HTTP headers. I’ll create a new file for this function. This will include options for extracting the email from the user agent if it appears in parentheses. 

I need to ensure that the existing setup replicates what we had before, but now with deduplication in mind. I'll also modify `scan_catalogue.py` to make sure it uses these updated headers when creating sessions. Let's get started on implementing these changes!
**Implementing necessary edits**

Alright, I need to start by importing the necessary functions and files for the project. My plan involves creating a new file, then making edits to both `extract.py` and `scan_catalogue.py`. I want to keep the changes as simple as possible, focusing on minimal differences in the code. After that, I’ll update the to-do list to reflect these changes. Time to get to work!</details></think>

HTTP header construction is now centralized:

• New helper `scaffold/http_utils.py` with `build_default_headers()`.  
• Both `extract.py` and `scan_catalogue.py` now import and use this function.  
• Removed duplicate header-building code; no lint issues introduced.

All tasks except optional page-caching are complete. Ready to implement offline caching next or handle any other new requirements you may have.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing caching for book pages**

I’m looking at our remaining task, which involves optionally caching raw book pages for offline parsing. I’ll need to adjust the `scan_catalogue.py` to create a local cache directory for storing HTML content. The plan is to check if a cached file exists during retrieval. If it does, I’ll read from it; if not, I’ll fetch and store it.

I’m also considering updating the configuration for ease. Overall, I’ll define a straightforward caching system. Let's get started on this!</details></think>

Page caching is now active:

• A `page_cache/` directory inside `data/daphnet`.  
• Each book-page URL maps to a safe filename via `quote_plus`.  
• `fetch_html` first tries the cached file; on network success it saves HTML for next time.  

All outstanding todos are now completed. The project’s scanner and extractor are robust, rate-optimised, cache-enabled, and share header logic. Let me know if there’s any further enhancement or testing you’d like to perform!
